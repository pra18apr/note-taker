To get a hold of this project, simply navigate to my Github profile and select the repo "note-taker". From there copy the SSH link into your terminal, Gitbash, or whatever application you prefer and use git copy and then paste link. You can then open it using VS Code or access the working app from the deployed link.

## Usage
In order to use the note taker, you must first aquire it through GitHub, see above how to do this. After you open it in VS Code, you may then use your computer's terminal or the terminal in VS Code. Do begin taking notes, navigate to the deployed link. Once you have navigated to the home page click the get started button. There you may begin taking notes by entering in a title, then writing a description. After that click the save icon and your new note is saved! Then click the delete icon for whichever notes you feel are not needed anymore.

## Learning Points
Through this project, I got more experience working in the back-end and got a better understanding of Express. I also learned how to use the app.delete syntax.
